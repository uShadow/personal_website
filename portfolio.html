            <p>
              I continue to develop intelligent gestural interfaces after my Master thesis project. However, instead of using a coloered glove, I'm using a Kinect for tracking bare hands. I am developing a systematic hierarchical approach to continuous gesture analysis using a unifying framework based on abstract hidden Markov models (AHMMs). Using this framework, I am creating a gesture-based interactive interface that allows users to do both manipulative and communicative gestures without artificial restrictions, and hence enabling natural interaction.

            <p>
              This is my Master thesis project. We developed a new multimodal tabletop interface for natural interaction, based on a <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rywang/handtracking/">new technology capable of real-time tracking of 3D hand postures</a>. We focus on natural gestures, i.e., those encountered in spontaneous interaction, rather than a set of artificial gestures designed for the convenience of recognition. We will also use an off-the-shelf speech recognition engine for keyword spotting, then combine speech and deictic gestures.

              This is a project I worked on when I was	an undergraduate research assistant at the Media and Graphics Interdisciplinary Centre (MAGIC) at UBC in the summer of 2008. It is about using hand gestures to produce synthetic vocal expression. I developed software modules for streaming data from Cyberglove and Polhemus tracker efficiently and robustly. I also helped with developing the user interface for the gesture training session and the vocal performance session. The final system is a real-time, compact and wearable system such that a person can wear and walk around to make an artistic performance. Here is a <a href="http://www.magic.ubc.ca/artisynth/uploads/VisualVoice/DIVA-Performance-Japan09HQ.mov" target="_self">video</a> of Marguerite Witvoet, a vocal artist, performing using the system at Ritsumeikan University in Japan in January 2009.

              Clutter is a Chrome extension that allows users to view multiple websites in the same tab. It is especially useful for ChromeOS notebook where you can only have one window, but want to view several websites at the same time. In general, it is very useful for viewing and comparing websites side by side when preparing for a trip, doing online shopping or making a personal dashboard. I was involved in developing the interface using HTML5 and CSS3. Our team won the top prize in the <a href="http://jankleinert.com/2011/03/01/chrome-hackathon-recap/">Chrome hackathon</a>.

The game is a 3D verison of the classic 2D Scortched Earth. In the game, two players on a randomly generated terrain take turns in launching attacks against one another until only one remains. The team members are Neema Teymory, Andrew Wong, Lane Feltis and me. The program is based on OpenGL and SDL libraries.

              This is a sequence of individual lab assignments for the graduate course 6.824 Distributed Systems at MIT. We built a multi-server file system called Yet-Another File System (YFS) in the spirit of <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/thekkath-frangipani.pdf">Frangipani</a>, using replicated state machine for fault tolerance and Paxos consensus algorithm for agreeing on master election. The last part of the lab is a project which we can add whatever extensions to the file system. I added read/write locking and peer-to-peer data transfer to improve the concurrency of the YFS.

              This is a course project for EECE 411 Design of Distributed Software Applications at UBC. We built a Gnutella network crawler with 50+ crawler workers deployed on PlanetLab nodes to collect information about the nodes participating in the network and the files shared. We used a master/worker approach with non-blocking I/O on the worker side. We also used dynamic work distribution to maximize performance and promote scalability.
